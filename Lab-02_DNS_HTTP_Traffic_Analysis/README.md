# Lab-02: DNS & HTTP Traffic Analysis

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this lab is to analyze **DNS and HTTP network traffic** using Wireshark in order to understand how domain name resolution and web communication work at the packet level. This lab focuses on observing real network behavior and identifying potential security weaknesses in unencrypted traffic.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Wireshark** – Network protocol analyzer

---

## 🌐 Protocols Analyzed
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**

---

## 🔍 Lab Overview
In this lab, a short packet capture was performed while accessing common websites. The captured traffic was filtered and analyzed to observe:

- HTTP request and response behavior
- Communication between client and server at the network layer
