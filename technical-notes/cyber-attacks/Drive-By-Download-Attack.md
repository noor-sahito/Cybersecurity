What is Drive-By Download Attack

You click a link →
A malicious website automatically downloads malware or exploits the browser/app.

This is more common on:
	•	Old Android phones
	•	Outdated browsers
	•	Pirated apps / APK installs

 How it works (high-level)
	1.	Link opens malicious website
	2.	Website checks:
	•	Browser version
	•	OS version
	3.	If vulnerable → malware is downloaded or executed

 On Android
	•	APK prompts
	•	Fake “update” installs spyware

 On iPhone
	•	Rare (due to sandboxing)
	•	Requires zero-day exploits (very expensive, targeted)

 Prevention
	•	Keep OS & apps updated
	•	Never install APKs from unknown sources
	•	Disable “Install unknown apps”
	•	Use official app stores only
