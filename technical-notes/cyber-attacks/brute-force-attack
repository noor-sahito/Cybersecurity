Brute Force Attack
 Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:
1. Understand two main approaches to attacking a conventional encryption scheme.
2. Explain what a Brute Force Attack is.
3. Know about software tools used to perform brute force attacks.

  1. Approaches to Attack Conventional Encryption Schemes
There are two general approaches to attack encryption systems:
1. Cryptanalysis Attack
    * Uses mathematical and analytical techniques to find weaknesses in the encryption algorithm or deduce the key.
2. Brute Force Attack
    * Tests all possible keys systematically until the correct one is found.
    * Guaranteed to succeed eventually, but may take a long time.

 2. What is a Brute Force Attack?
* A brute force attack is a method of guessing passwords, keys, or encrypted data by trying every possible combination.
* The attacker does not rely on any cryptographic weakness — it is based purely on computation.
* Once the correct key or password is found, the encryption can be broken and the data revealed.

 3. Example – Key Space Concept
* The key space is the total number of possible keys.
* The larger the key space → the longer it takes to perform a brute force attack.

Example:
* Suppose the password consists of only one digit (0–9) → there are 10 possible combinations.
* If the password length increases to 2 digits, there are 10 × 10 = 100 possible combinations.
* As the number of characters increases, the number of possible keys grows exponentially.

4. Characteristics of Brute Force Attack
* Complete Search: Tries all possible keys or passwords.
* Time-Consuming: The time required depends on:
    * Key length.
    * Processing power of the attacker’s system.
* Guaranteed Success: If given unlimited time and resources, the attack will succeed.
* Computationally Expensive: Requires high processing power.

5. Tools Used for Brute Force Attacks
Some common tools available on the internet that can perform brute force attacks include:
* John the Ripper
* Hydra
* Medusa
* aircrack-ng
* DaveGrohl
* cain and abel
* hashcat
* rainbowcrack
* crack
* Ophcrack
 

 6. How to Prevent Brute Force Attacks
To defend against brute force attacks:
1. Use Strong Passwords: Long, complex passwords with letters, numbers, and symbols.
2. Implement CAPTCHA: Ensures the user is human, not an automated program.
3. Limit Login Attempts: Restrict number of failed login tries.
4. Account Lockout Policies: Temporarily lock account after multiple failed attempts.
5. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adds an extra verification step beyond the password.

 7. Key Points
Aspect	Description
Type of attack	Trial-and-error based
Target	Passwords or encryption keys
Success Rate	100% (eventually)
Limitation	Time and computational power
Defense	CAPTCHA, complex passwords, limited attempts

Summary
* A Brute Force Attack systematically tries every possible key or password until the correct one is found.
* It’s a guaranteed but slow attack method.
* Tools like John the Ripper and Hydra can automate this process.
* Protection methods include strong passwords, CAPTCHA, and 2FA.
