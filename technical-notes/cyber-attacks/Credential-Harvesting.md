what is Credential Harvesting

The link opens a fake login page:
	•	Facebook
	•	Instagram
	•	Google
	•	Apple ID
	•	Bank

You login → attacker logs in as you → steals data → resets passwords.

 Prevention
	•	Never login via links
	•	Always open apps manually
	•	Use password managers (they warn on fake sites)
